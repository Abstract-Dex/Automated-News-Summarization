It has made several\\necommerce\\npushes over the past decade without much success.\\nBut now, consultants say brands, especially those peddling niche and\\nhigh-end products\\n, are finally seeing sales breaking through this year amid a difficult retail environment.\\nWhile retailers have been forced by penny-pinching consumers into heavy discounting on other ecommerce platforms such as Alibaba\\'s Taobao and PDD Holdings\\' Pinduoduo, Xiaohongshu\\'s focus on aspirational lifestyles is attracting less price-sensitive users.\\n\"Brands really value a following on Xiaohongshu, because the consumption power is totally different\" to other platforms, said Suya Wang, general manager at Early Data, a Shanghai-based consultancy.\\nWhile some brands including L\\'Oreal and Tapestry\\'s Coach have opened their own stores on the platform, many brands are also investing in partnerships with influencers who livestream selections of products from multiple brands and categories.\\n\"There is a better chance of us being discovered by the right consumers because this is where people go to research female-oriented lifestyle products,\" said Melody Zhao, an investor in period care brand Enya. Xiaohongshu ecommerce will be a priority for the brand\\'s market entry early next year, she added.\\nXiaohongshu was late to the livestream sales boom in China led by Alibaba\\'s Tmall and ByteDance\\'s Douyin, but in 2022 it combined its ecommerce and livestreaming divisions, incorporating purchasing functions into livestreams.\\nInfluencers livestreaming on Xiaohongshu tend to employ a quieter, conversational tone when speaking to viewers, setting themselves apart from fast-talking, high-energy hosts on other platforms that use aggressive sales tactics.\\nIan Hylton, president of Ms Min, an independent Chinese designer brand which sells knitted sweaters priced at over 5,000 yuan, said they were caught off guard by a sudden growth in Xiaohongshu sales after being featured in a livestream hosted by Chinese actress Dong Jie.\\n\"We never approached Xiaohongshu as a selling platform, it was a place to tell our stories and to raise brand awareness,\" he said. \"But when Dong Jie talks about Ms Min, we can sell hundreds of units of an item following a single livestream,\" Hylton said.\\nIvan Gu of Magic Advertising, an agency that manages the social media and ecommerce operations of luxury brands, said a lot of his clients, including Max Mara and LVMH, were looking more seriously to Xiaohongshu as a sales driver.\\nPlans, still in the works, include opening stores and running more livestreams, or setting up brand sales associates as livestream hosts on the platform, a phenomenon known as KOS - or key opinion sales - in China.\\n\\'\\nTriple digit gains\\'\\nXiaohongshu, whose name translates to \"little red book\", is similar to Meta\\'s Instagram in that it allows users to curate photos, videos and text documenting their lives. In recent years it has also become a de facto search engine for young women looking for travel tips, anti-aging creams and restaurant recommendations.\\nThe company, a privately held firm with over 300 million users and a reported valuation of $17 billion after its latest funding round in July, declined interview requests from Reuters and did not respond to questions regarding its sales revenue. Hongshan (previously Sequoia China), Hillhouse, Boyu, and Citic Capital are all among Xiaohongshu\\'s investors.\\nXiaohongshu has stayed largely quiet about its ecommerce strategy but Jacob Cooke, CEO of ecommerce consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies who works with brands looking to join the platform, said it has been hiring staff away from competitors Alibaba and ByteDance\\'s Douyin in a sign of its ambition.\\n\"We\\'re anticipating triple digit gains in Xiaohongshu\\'s GMV (gross merchandise volume, a measure of sales) next year,\" Cooke said, estimating the platform will top $100 billion in sales revenue in 2025.\\nOthers however, say that Xiaohongshu will likely remain niche as a ecommerce player and not a real threat to larger platforms.\\nTmall, JD.com and Pinduoduo, China\\'s top three platforms, account for more than 90% of the country\\'s $2.78 trillion in GMV, according to data consultancy Syntun.\\n\"Compared with large platforms, their GMV is too small and so they don\\'t have substantial platform influence,\" Beijing-based tech and ecommerce analyst Li Chengdong said.\\n($1 = 7.2768 Chinese yuan renminbi)', 'rights': 'indiatimes.com', 'rank': 281, 'topic': 'business', 'country': 'IN', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'www.ETBrand Equity.com,Reuters', 'media': 'https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-116385502,imgsize-145684,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etbrandequity/marketing/chinas-instagram-like-xiaohongshu-making-inroads-with-ecommerce-sales.jpg', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': 'http://twitter.com/ETBrandEquity', '_score': 1.9931567, '_id': '7190f323b1369890227685fde0beab7e'}, {'title': 'Success Story: सिर्फ 110 रुपये से की थी शुरुआत, अब करोड़ों की कमाई, ऐसा क्\\u200dया किया?', 'author': 'अमित शुक्\\u200dला', 'published_date': '2024-12-17 07:00:00', 'published_date_precision': 'timezone unknown', 'link': 'https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/business/business-news/success-story-of-saheli-chatterjee-who-started-her-business-journey-with-rs-110-now-earning-in-crores/articleshow/116379039.cms', 'clean_url': 'indiatimes.com', 'excerpt': 'Success Story of Saheli: सहेली चटर्जी ने कभी 110 रुपये से अपने करियर की शुरुआत की थी। अब वह सालाना 1.64 करोड़ की कमाई कर रही है। बेथ्यून कॉलेज से पढ़ी सहेली ने डिजिटल मार्केटिंग में अपना करियर बनाया…', 'summary': \"Confirm our vendors\\nVendors can use your data to provide services.

Together, we can replace stigma with support, judgment with…', 'summary': 'Reframing Tobacco Addiction: From Stigma to Solutions\\nFor decades, smoking has remained one of the most devastating public health crises worldwide. However, societal misconceptions persist, casting judgment on those who smoke and labelling them weak-willed, morally flawed, or simply overindulgent. These stigmas are not only inaccurate, but deeply harmful. Science has long proven that addiction is not a personal failing but a chronic medical condition - one that rewires the brain, fosters dependency, and requires medical support and systemic change to overcome. Despite this, millions remain trapped in cycles of shame, isolation, and addiction, perpetuated by judgment and limited access to solutions.\\nStigma: The Invisible Barrier to Recovery\\nStigma extends beyond being a social barrier; it traps those who smoke in cycles of dependency and shame. They are often judged as having chosen their fate, rather than being seen as individuals battling a medical condition. This harsh perception fuels guilt and hopelessness, discouraging many from seeking help. Even with effective treatments and technologies available, societal attitudes and policies often deter those who smoke from accessing them, leaving them to face their struggles in isolation.\\n\"Tobacco addiction is a medical condition, just like any other, and it should be treated as such. I wouldn\\'t tell my patients with asthma to simply rely on air purifiers to treat the condition they suffer from. I would prescribe inhalers to help manage their condition. Similarly, smoking should be approached with the same medical perspective, rather than criminalizing and stigmatizing those who struggle with the addiction.\"\\nDespite the Indian judiciary system recognizing addiction as a medical condition, societal attitudes and policymaking continue to lag behind. Misconceptions persist, leaving those who smoke feeling marginalized. While evidence-based treatments like nicotine replacement therapies are available, the limited availability and cost of harm reduction products restricts options for those seeking alternatives. Combined with a fear of judgment, this further discourages those who smoke from pursuing available support.\\nThe Socio-Economic Impact of Tobacco Addiction\\nTobacco addiction impacts not just individual health but also families, communities, and economies. Families bear emotional and financial burdens, with loved ones becoming caregivers and facing costly treatments. This strain disrupts family dynamics, leads to income loss, and reduces overall quality of life. In India, the economic toll of tobacco use is estimated at ₹177,000 crore annually, highlighting the urgent need for harm reduction and support initiatives. Communities also suffer from decreased productivity and higher healthcare expenses.\\nAdditionally, the harm caused by tobacco perpetuates cycles of poverty, especially in rural areas where farmers rely on tobacco cultivation for their livelihoods. These socio-economic dependencies complicate the implementation of cessation programs and policies, without addressing the structural dependencies on tobacco.\\nThe Psychiatric Gap and the Need for Accessible Interventions\\nWhile psychiatrists and mental health professionals play a vital role in treating tobacco addiction, a vast majority of those who smoke—nearly 99%—avoid seeking treatment because of stigma or a lack of awareness. Even among those who access care, treatments like antidepressants or anxiolytics without proper follow-up rarely lead to long-term recovery. Many also turn to \"replacement addictions\" as they attempt to quit, creating a complex issue that only worsens without a comprehensive solution.\\nTechnology: A New Frontier in Breaking Barriers\\nIncorporating technology can greatly aid the journey of recovery. Digital tools like AI-driven health apps, virtual counseling platforms, and personalized health tracking devices offer accessible, evidence-based interventions at scale. These technologies can ease the recovery process by providing behavioral prompts, education, and personalized care that work alongside traditional healthcare systems.\\nFurthermore, advancements in technology have led to the development of new harm reduction products, which provide safer alternatives to traditional tobacco use and reduce associated health risks.\\nThese tools are not meant to replace human interaction but to enhance it—offering opportunities for personalized care, community outreach, and harm reduction strategies that can reach millions, including those in underserved areas.\\nFrom Stigma to Solutions: A Path Forward\\nBreaking the cycle of tobacco addiction requires collective action rooted in compassion. Solutions must go beyond treatment to dismantle stigma, build support networks, and promote education. Governments, organizations, and communities must collaborate to create inclusive policies that address addiction\\'s socio-economic effects, prioritize affordability, and ensure access to innovative harm reduction tools.\\nReframing addiction as a medical issue rather than a moral failing opens the door to recovery without shame. Together, we can replace stigma with support, judgment with understanding, and isolation with community. The time to act is now— let us build healthier, more resilient societies where every individual can reclaim their health and future.\\nAuthored by: Dr. Lancelot Mark Pinto, Consultant Pulmonologist and Epidemiologist, PD Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre.\\nReady to Master Stock Valuation?

He foresees AI playing a key role in India's online education sector in the future while also boosting the entrepreneurial ecosystem. He also warns against the trend of CEOs trying to fit in by doing short AI courses as a 'top-up' without deeply understanding the concept. Excerpts:\\nAI cannot be singled out in the development of a country. In India there's so much going on in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, semiconductors, renewables and in medical devices. AI is one of those happening sectors. On a macro basis for the government, it can be an incredible enabler to use AI to administer services, for data collection etc.\\nBut what I can say is that AI will augment learning. It can generate and extract better case studies than probably Harvard. It will also play a supplementary role in formal education. It will also make you job ready by telling you what gaps need to be filled for you to fit into the market. So, it will be different things for different people.\\nData gathering is where AI can create the most impact. In a physical space where there are 40 students, the teacher/professor will be able to track them only in a limited way and also probably get to track their habits when they meet outside.Also Read | Zerodha CTO Kailash Nadh: Having no investor pressure gives us the product edge\\nHowever, an online setting provides a reservoir of information. For example, if someone has gone through a marketing chapter thrice, we'll have a buddy call them and say, hey, we think you are having a problem with this chapter. You haven't worked out the questions provided etc. So, we'll have that kind of information and data about people and their learning patterns. Then there are the peer patterns. How many of them have asked questions on the chapter and posted it online? How many of them have been collaborative in this exercise? There'll be an incredible amount of data thanks to AI.\\nThen comes the whole counselling space with bots. There's a whole lot of demand for it. People often feel they are at crossroads in their career and need some counselling to come out of that. That's going to be a trend.\\nOne can also open up a reservoir of working professionals who can become teachers and guides by using AI tools in online teaching without having to do teaching for life. You can get paid well for it and find the whole process very gratifying especially if it's in your particular space.\\nIt's a bit tricky because kids at an early-age fall in the vision of their parents. People like you and me would want them to go through formal education because we don't want to short change them. Till they turn 15-16, they'll go through formal education and it's only after that the kids will start to communicate what they would like to do. Already, home schooling and online schooling have taken off.\\nI can't see AI impacting formal education in this generation but maybe next.\\nAbsolutely. Both self-employment and entrepreneurship will get a fillip through AI. As far as self-employment is concerned, I think there is going to be this boom of experts who are specialists in one area or two and they would want to become consultants. It's like having two different DNAs at work. Companies will not accept it. But who cares? If that's what the workforce wants, that's where they'll have to go. This will trigger a duality in career opportunities.\\nToday, about 50% of our enrolments are in the hospitality sector. Everyone wants to learn about F&B. They keep reading about how every other week another 100km of road is being added to the network. They know that a McDonald's or some other food place is opening up on the highway on a consistent basis. Even in masonry, 90% of the people want to be self-employed and don't care about a job. They just want to get skilled.Also Read | Ronnie Screwvala says Shah Rukh Khan's Swades deserves a re-release\\nNo question that AI is going to be a big time-saver. You keep saving 2,3 hours every day at work and that's pure gold. It's going to trigger you to think differently.\\nThere's going to be some automation; especially in a country like India where we have been used for low wages and outsourcing. If you are potent and well trained in ML and AI you can command large premium jobs around the world. We should use them more as assets.\\nLook, India will have a problem of creating jobs for its youth (something like 200 million jobs). Banking and insurance and other finance verticals aren't creating enough of them. So, it's a generic problem and you cannot blame it on one technology. Even some of the larger companies betting on AI will soon have a reality check on how to monetise the business. There seems to be an incredible amount of euphoria in some quarters for no reason.\\nIn a way it's good as it hurtles you towards something in two years what otherwise would have taken five. Big money is backing it too.\\nPeople are looking for hacks. That's not going to cut it in AI. The CEOs have so much fomo today and they feel they need a top-up course in AI. A lot of CEOs want to do a short course and that doesn't mean much.\\nSkilling and training are now primarily about machine learning and AI. MBAs are going to be about data analytics. Do not look for a hack.\\nI don't have a meaning for it. Maybe it's nice for some HR folks to post that and get some talent. It's a positioning thing, just to be part of the whole buzz. I'm calling it buzz, not fluff.\\nI think most people want an ingredient of it. It's positioning as I said because if you know some of those ingredients of AI, then they can participate in more of their group meetings in office.\\nIt's becoming clear that Gen Z is going to use AI more as a glorified hack and why not? They are more circumspect about time and attention span. They will drive the consumption patterns.\\nA mature work force has a tick mark against it even in this era. Their vast experience and the resultant gut feel they have acquired are major ticks. That's not going to be replaced by AI or GenZ. However, it'll force 40+ people to be more collaborative and get 1-2 people who understand the new trends to work around them and then be super smart about it.\\nIf I'm in that situation, I would like to be surrounded by a team where 25% of the people are aware (AI ready). I can then leverage my thought process around it and bring that to the table rather than get intimidated saying 'I'll have to copy them' because what they can't bring to the table are things that I do bring at 40.\\nRight now, I'll be a bit more careful in investing in AI companies. I wouldn't like to be the earliest investor as I don't suffer from fomo. Nearly 99% of them will get found out and fall by the wayside. We have seen that through the Internet age of the '90s. Having said that I've invested in AI startups like ZuAI (AI powered personal tutor app).\\nScript writers or story tellers are never going to be out of business. There's an incredible amount of EQ that's a huge part of successful story telling. I don't think AI can trigger that emotion; the nuanced part of EQ-led story telling can never get replaced. Also, the power of envisaging trends. That's probably out of the realm of what AI can do at the moment.\\nLet me clarify one thing here. The examples that you mentioned were more of investor debacles or issues that emanated out of founder immaturity. It's not a sectoral problem. If Yes Bank had a problem, it cannot be seen as a banking sector issue or if Jet Airways went bankrupt it didn't mean that aviation was an unviable business.\\nI want upGrad to be a forever learning company. It's a key part of where we want to be. I want to create an ecosystem where almost everyone can become a teacher. We'll make online teaching attractive, even for non-teachers who are experts in their fields.\\nAlso, take this from me. We'll look to beat Zomato and Zepto at their own game. Let's say someone needs a counsellor in 10 minutes. We'll get the counsellor in 10 minutes, just like in quick commerce.\\nGoing forward, people will want more than just groceries. Let's say you want some quick help before facing a job interview and are looking for a hack. We'll send that to you in a hurry. We'll also expand globally.\\n(Note to readers: Aye, AI is a column that deals with Artificial Intelligence and its possibilities by engaging in conversations with the brightest in business)\", 'rights': 'hindustantimes.com', 'rank': 875, 'topic': 'business', 'country': 'IN', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'Darlington Jose Hector', 'media': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/17/1600x900/Ronnie_Screwvala_1734405173593_1734405173841.jpg', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': '@httweets', '_score': 1.9788736, '_id': '6535ed4da55f5266932dbd733d69d91f'}, {'title': \"Delhi's Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana: Who are eligible?

During the course of arguments, the petitioner's counsel contended that the prosecution had submitted only a screenshot of the reported Facebook post and failed to prove its authenticity.\\nThe counsel said the police had not produced a certificate under Section 65B of the Information Technology Act to prove the authenticity of the electronic record. However, the judge wondered what was the necessity for the prosecution to produce such a certificate when the petitioner himself had tendered an apology while urging the court to quash the case booked against him.\\nJustice Velmurugan pointed out that while tendering the unconditional apology, the petitioner had stated that the message was authored by someone else and that he had shared it on his Facebook account inadvertently without reading it properly. 'Will you share anything and everything that you receive on social media,' the judge asked the revision petitioner's counsel.\\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh had dismissed the quash petition in July 2023 after observing that though the petitioner was an educated person and a well-known figure in the State with a large fan following, a careful reading of the Facebook post, containing abusive and vulgar comments, shared by him on April 19, 2018 had showcased the women journalists in very bad light.\\n'This court is very hesitant to even translate the message that was forwarded [shared] by the petitioner since, to say the least, it is despicable. The contents are highly derogatory against the Press as a whole in Tamil Nadu... A message that is sent or forwarded in the social media is like an arrow, which has already been shot from the bow.... the sender of the message must take the ownership for the consequences,' the judge had said.\\nPublished\\n- December 17, 2024 01:05 pm IST\\nRead Comments\\nCopy link\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nTelegram\\nLinkedIn\\nWhatsApp\\nReddit\\nREAD LATER\\nPRINT\\nRelated Topics\\n/\", 'rights': 'thehindu.com', 'rank': 1065, 'topic': 'business', 'country': 'IN', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'The Hindu Bureau', 'media': 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ntanze/article68994913.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_HUMOUR_SOCIETY_2_1_UTBKT5Q1.jpg', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': ' The Hindu Bureau', '_score': 1.974559, '_id': '6c64eee9a3af4c287e598e180dd8f02f'}, {'title': \"India's Tata faces pressure in Starbucks joint venture as consumers cut back\", 'author': 'Reuters', 'published_date': '2024-12-16 20:49:00', 'published_date_precision': 'timezone unknown', 'link': 'https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/indias-tata-faces-pressure-in-starbucks-joint-venture-as-consumers-cut-back/article68993314.ece', 'clean_url': 'thehindu.com', 'excerpt': 'Tata Consumer CEO adjusts Starbucks store opening plans, maintains goal of 1,000 stores by 2028.', 'summary': 'India\\'s Tata Consumer Products will push back plans for some new Starbucks store openings until later in its existing schedule as fewer customers are walking into its cafes in the world\\'s most populous country, its top boss said on Monday (December 16, 2024).\\n\"We will calibrate for the short term — maybe instead of opening 100, we will open 80 now, and next year we will open 120 instead of 100,\" Tata Consumer CEO Sunil D\\'Souza told\\nReuters\\n, adding that Tata Starbucks is still focused on\\nCity dwellers in India are cutting spending on everything from cookies and coffee to fast food as persistently high inflation squeezes middle class budgets, with wages failing to keep pace.\\nIts store numbers had more than doubled from four years ago by the last financial year, but Mr. D\\'Souza said a lack of quality locations is a roadblock.\\n\"In India, good quality real estate with traffic... is a challenge,\" he said, contrasting that to the \"massive development of malls\" in China, Starbucks\\' second largest market and the second most populous country after India.\\nTata Starbucks has beefed up its dedicated team to plan for store openings, keeping an eye out for upcoming real estate development and shortlisting locations ahead of time.\\nSales at Tata Starbucks rose 12% to ₹12.18 billion ($143.6 million) in the last financial year, while its net loss widened to ₹800 million from ₹250 million.

Higher inflation and interest costs also exerted pressure on clients across key industries, resulting in increasing focus on cost optimisation, business critical projects, and deferment of large discretionary spends, it said.\\nAccording to ICRA analysis, moderation in demand coupled with the increase in utilisation of excess manpower added during FY2022-FY2023 exerted pressure on hiring by IT services companies through FY2024 and Q1 FY2025. ''While there has been some recovery in Q2 FY2025, ICRA expects hiring to remain low in the near term until the growth momentum picks up by H2 FY2026,'' it said.\\nAlso, employee attrition has declined in recent quarters beginning from Q3 FY2023 for most Indian IT services companies, which has helped reduce the demand-supply mismatch witnessed in the industry, after the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nOn average revenue per employee, ICRA observed that it has been stable around $ 50,000 over FY2020-FY2024, however, this metric would show steady improvement if assessed on revenue in rupee terms due to depreciation of the rupee against some key foreign currencies over this period. The number of employees required for every $100 million of revenue generation has also largely remained stable at around 2000 over the same period. However, the same parameters assessed on revenue reported in rupee terms would show steady improvement over this period, primarily due to depreciation of the rupee against some key foreign currencies, it said.\\nAlso, employee cost as a percentage of operating income for ICRA's sample set increased steadily to 58% in FY2024 from 54% in FY2021, due to moderation in revenue growth coupled with wage cost inflation amid surge in attrition levels till H1 FY2024.\\n''While this has exerted pressure on operating profit margins (OPM) of the companies, they have been able to partly offset the same through increased operating efficiencies and employee utilisation levels. ICRA expects the OPM for its sample set companies to largely remain stable at 21-22% over FY2025–FY2026,'' it predicted.\\nPublished\\n- December 16, 2024 09:23 pm IST\\nRead Comments\\nCopy link\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nTelegram\\nLinkedIn\\nWhatsApp\\nReddit\\nREAD LATER\\nPRINT\", 'rights': 'thehindu.com', 'rank': 1065, 'topic': 'business', 'country': 'IN', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'The Hindu Bureau', 'media': 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': ' The Hindu Bureau', '_score': 1.9744383, '_id': 'e76aa5d39ac11acad6c9c8529f2712db'}, {'title': 'CAG pulls up 16 govt.-owned entities for governance lapses', 'author': 'Vikas Dhoot', 'published_date': '2024-12-16 16:31:35', 'published_date_precision': 'full', 'link': 'https://www.thehindu.com/business/cag-pulls-up-16-govt-owned-entities-for-governance-lapses/article68993201.ece', 'clean_url': 'thehindu.com', 'excerpt': 'CAG report highlights governance lapses in Indian public sector enterprises, with ONGC and NHAI accounting for major financial implications.', 'summary': \"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), in a compliance audit report on central public sector enterprises, pulled up 16 government-owned entities for governance lapses that resulted in adverse financial implications of ₹3,437.30 crore, with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) accounting for well over a third of these financial infirmities.\\nThe biggest observation from the CAG's report tabled in Parliament on Monday, pertains to what it termed an 'imprudent decision' by ONGC to acquire a 70% participating interest in a gas block despite a its technical panel assessing that it had a mere 11.2% shot at success, leading to wasteful expenditure of ₹557.6 crore as well as a failure to recover the partner contractor's share of ₹132.9 crore.\\nApart from other lapses by ONGC worth almost ₹182 crore, the CAG has pulled up the NHAI for lapses worth almost ₹445 crore, including a case where it extended undue benefit of ₹203.1 crore to a consortium of contractors involved in four highway projects in Maharashtra.\\nPublished\\n- December 16, 2024 10:01 pm IST\\nRead Comments\\nCopy link\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nTelegram\\nLinkedIn\\nWhatsApp\\nReddit\\nREAD LATER\\nPRINT\", 'rights': 'thehindu.com', 'rank': 1065, 'topic': 'business', 'country': 'IN', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'Vikas Dhoot', 'media': 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': 'Vikas Dhoot', '_score': 1.9744383, '_id': 'a914724cbc8ce321caa77f8a5f0f42a3'}, {'title': 'Markets decline in early trade dragged by Reliance, HDFC Bank; caution ahead of U.S. Fed rate decision', 'author': 'PTI', 'published_date': '2024-12-17 05:23:06', 'published_date_precision': 'full', 'link': 'https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/markets-decline-in-early-trade-dragged-by-reliance-hdfc-bank-caution-ahead-of-us-fed-rate-decision/article68994588.ece', 'clean_url': 'thehindu.com', 'excerpt': 'Equity indices Sensex and Nifty fall as investors await U.S. Fed rate decision, with blue-chip stocks declining.', 'summary': 'Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty declined in early trade on Tuesday (December 17, 2024) amid cautious investors approach ahead of the U.S. Fed interest rate decision and selling in blue-chip stocks like Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank.\\nThe 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex declined 350.98 points to 81,397.59 in early trade.

Business confidence is at its lowest since 2021, a long-running manufacturing crisis is deepening, and the services sector which had propped up the economy for most of the year is now also contracting.\\n\"Italy\\'s business model made up of small firms is no longer conducive to growth, it has insufficient public investment and it is fighting the green transition instead of embracing it as a growth opportunity,\" said Francesco Saraceno, economics professor at Paris\\'s Science Po and Rome\\'s LUISS university.\\nAnalysts say the situation is even more worrying considering that Italy is receiving a constant flow of tens of billions of euros from Brussels as part of the European Union\\'s post-COVID Recovery Fund.\\nSpain, the other main recipient of the fund, is growing at least four times as fast.\\nShort-term boost\\nMr. Saraceno said Italy\\'s buoyancy in 2021-2022 was based mainly on state-funded incentives for the building sector--the so-called \"superbonus\"--which powered an investment surge that has reversed this year as the costly scheme has been phased out.\\nItaly has been the most sluggish euro zone economy since the launch of the single currency 25 years ago, and its latest slump threatens to derail its public finances that have already been compromised by the superbonus.\\nThe public debt, proportionally the second largest in the euro zone, is forecast by the government to rise to around 138% of GDP in 2026 from 135% last year.\\nIf growth in 2025 comes in significantly below Rome\\'s 1.2% target, as most forecasters now expect, that debt ratio will probably climb faster. Investors may then become more reluctant to buy Italian bonds, increasing the government\\'s heavy debt-servicing burden.\\nItaly is already under EU orders to slash its budget deficit due to massive overshoots in the last two years, removing any hope of spending its way to growth.\\nSpain powers ahead\\nThe country\\'s weakness stands in stark contrast to Spain, whose GDP is forecast to grow by around 3% this year. Over the last year Spain has expanded at quarterly rates of between 0.7% and 0.9%, while Italy has hovered between zero and 0.3%.\\nAngel Talavera, head of European research at Oxford Economics, said Spain\\'s success in attracting migrants and integrating them into its economy had been a key driver of its growth, along with a tourism boom and firm consumer spending.\\nItaly\\'s far fewer migrants rarely do skilled or even semi-skilled jobs, and are often confined to the informal economy. Meanwhile young Italians are leaving the country in their thousands due to a lack of promising career prospects. The shrinking population is in itself a source of economic weakness.\\n\"They are quite different types of economies, Spain is strongly reliant on services and tourism, while Italy still has a large manufacturing sector which is increasingly uncompetitive and acting as a brake on expansion,\" Ms. Talavera said.\\n\"Over the last 20 years Spain also seems to have done a better job of modernising its infrastructures and public services,\" he added.\\nIt\\'s education, stupid\\nEconomists agree that an incomplete list of Italy\\'s problems includes under-investment in education, infrastructure and public services, stifling bureaucracy, risk-averse banks, an under-developed stock market and an inefficient justice system--all issues that have lain unresolved for years.\\nThere is also a perhaps surprising degree of consensus on what the top policy priority should be to improve things, a question put by Reuters to five prominent Italian economists.\\nRoberto Perotti, economics professor at Milan\\'s Bocconi University, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a former European Central Bank board member, Andrea Roventini, economics professor at Pisa\\'s Sant\\'Anna University and Science Po\\'s Saraceno all said the focus should be on investment in education and research.\\nLorenzo Codogno, head of LC Macro Advisors and a former Italian Treasury chief economist, said his priority would be further liberalisation of the labour market.\\nPublished\\n- December 17, 2024 05:53 pm IST\\nRead Comments\\nCopy link\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nTelegram\\nLinkedIn\\nWhatsApp\\nReddit\\nREAD LATER\\nPRINT', 'rights': 'thehindu.com', 'rank': 1065, 'topic': 'business', 'country': 'IN', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'Reuters', 'media': 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': '@The_Hindu', '_score': 1.9744383, '_id': '9a46be2ae8f2cbead083d4f1c0a0f99f'}, {'title': \"Vietnam's sweeping administrative cuts stir investors' anticipation, worries\", 'author': 'CUE API', 'published_date': '2024-12-17 12:19:44', 'published_date_precision': 'full', 'link': 'https://www.thehindu.com/business/vietnams-sweeping-administrative-cuts-stir-investors-anticipation-worries/article68995857.ece', 'clean_url': 'thehindu.com', 'excerpt': 'Communist-run Vietnam is planning its boldest bureaucratic reform in decades, slashing ministries, agencies and broadcasters in a bid to reduce bottlenecks and red tape, but risking short-term…', 'summary': 'Communist-run Vietnam is planning its boldest bureaucratic reform in decades, slashing ministries, agencies and broadcasters in a bid to reduce bottlenecks and red tape, but risking short-term \"paralysis\", officials and investors said.\\nUnder the plan, five ministries, four government agencies and five state TV channels would be among the bodies that will cease to exist, according to Communist Party documents reviewed by Reuters and reports in state media. The proposal is still in its preliminary stages and is subject to changes by the time is set to be voted in parliament in February.\\nNo figure has been circulated about the number of jobs that could be cut, but thousands of state employees are likely to be affected, based on the magnitude of the cuts envisaged in the documents.\\nVietnam, a Southeast Asian industrial hub, relies heavily on foreign investment in manufacturing, which fuels a booming export-oriented economy.\\nHowever, in recent years investors\\' discontent has grown louder over delays in project approvals and regulatory reforms compounded by a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.\\nResponding to that criticism, Vietnam\\'s new Communist Party leader To Lam this month launched a massive overhaul of state bodies, soon after he was appointed to the country\\'s most powerful job.\\nVietnam\\'s home and foreign affairs ministries did not reply to requests for comment.\\nThe bold move comes about a year before the Communist Party congress, which in early 2026 will decide whether to confirm Mr. Lam in his job.\\nIt also coincides with similar post-pandemic government cost-cutting measures being implemented or pledged across the world, including by Argentina\\'s libertarian President Javier Milei and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.\\nAmong the planned measures, the investment ministry, which is responsible for approving industrial projects, will be merged with the finance ministry.\\nFor a while \"investors may experience delays or uncertainty as the new structures are established and the dust of this top-level governance merger settles,\" said Leif Schneider, head of international law firm Luther in Vietnam.\\nBut \"the long-term outlook is more optimistic,\" he added, saying Vietnam could become a more investor-friendly destination if the reform is executed effectively.\\nMixed views\\nNine investors, diplomats and officials interviewed by Reuters shared the same mixed assessment with many anticipating new administrative delays in the short term.\\n\"Expect paralysis to be the normal for a while,\" said a Western Hanoi-based diplomat, who also speculated that the reform may also be an attempt by Mr. Lam to consolidate power.\\nTwo foreign investors expected the reform would bring about long-awaited simplified procedures for businesses, although it was likely to slow project approvals for some months.\\nThey declined to be identified to speak more freely.\\nAustralia\\'s ambassador in Hanoi Andrew Goledzinowski likened the current phase to Vietnam\\'s wide-ranging economic reforms of the 1980s, which turned the war-torn Communist country into a major trading nation in the following decades.\\n\"Vietnam\\'s New Era is dawning at a critical time\" as investors seek safe havens in a phase of growing protectionism, Mr. Goledzinowski wrote in a social media post.\\n\"Money is like water,\" he noted, however. \"When it is blocked, it goes

A decisive close above 24,775 would act as a strong trigger for renewed bullish momentum, signaling further upside in the near term. Should this breakout materialise, the next resistance levels to watch will be 25,125 and 25,625, presenting potential opportunities for traders to ride the upward trend.\\nOn the flip side, a failure to sustain above the breakout level and a close below 24,480 would indicate a pullback in the ongoing bullish trend. In such a scenario, support is expected at 24,250 and 24,050, where buying interest is likely to emerge, preventing further downside.\\nTechnical indicators remain broadly supportive of the bullish bias, with the index expected to outperform in the near term. Traders should consider the best strategy as accumulating positions near support levels, particularly around 24,250–24,050, to optimise risk-reward. Maintaining a strict stop-loss near 24,000 will safeguard against unexpected reversals.\\nIn conclusion, the Nifty 50 Index remains well-placed to outperform, and traders should align their strategies accordingly, focusing on buying dips and capitalising on bullish momentum.\\nNifty Bank Index: Awaiting Breakout for Clear Direction\\nThe Nifty Bank Index is currently trading within a well-defined range of 53,750–53,350 on the charts, signaling a phase of near-term consolidation. A close above 53,750 would trigger fresh bullish momentum, leading the index towards its next resistance levels at 54,000, followed by 54,425 and 55,000. On the contrary, a breakdown below the lower range of 53,350 would indicate bearish pressure, with support levels emerging at 53,150, 52,775, and 52,050.\\nThe technical setup suggests traders should adopt a wait-and-watch approach until a decisive breakout occurs on either side, as such a move would set the tone for clear trading opportunities. For safe traders, the best strategy would be to trade only after a confirmed breakout to capitalise on a directional trend. On the other hand, risky traders could look to sell on rise, particularly near resistance levels, with a strict stop-loss at 54,000, which coincides with the highest open interest build-up as per derivatives data.\\nTechnical indicators currently show indecision, further emphasising the need for caution. In conclusion, while the index remains range-bound, prudent traders should wait for a breakout, while aggressive traders can explore selling opportunities near resistance, keeping risk management a priority.\\n===================\\nDisclaimer: Ravi Nathani is an independent technical analyst.

This shift aims to change the way users think about Corefactors. With this rebranding, Corefactors showcases its evolution from a CRM with in-built cloud telephony and IVR services to a complete RevOps platform. Corefactors' new brand identity reflects a better and consistent user experience, which is crucial now that they are stepping into the international market. When asked about the decision to rebrand, Founder and CEO Sharmila Sundaram mentioned 'We no longer want to be known as just another CRM that helps with sales, marketing, support, and success. We want to be the torchbearer of RevOps, syncing all these 4 revenue-generating departments on one platform.'\\nCorefactors' has retained its iconic blue and added more bright shades to its palette of primary and secondary brand colors. The logo has changed from a play on the alphabet 'C' to an arrow that denotes growth and rise. This is perfectly aligned with their new tagline 'Your Revenue Multiplier'. The brand aims to position its RevOps platform as a solution for businesses of all sizes to plug their revenue leakage.\\nCorefactors now has over 10k users globally, with 400+ customers in India, Philippines, Albania, USA, and UAE. The company has clients from a range of industries including major players like Lenovo, Flipkart, Exide, Pidilite, Dr. Lal Path Labs, and Trdfin, among others.\\nThe product has received a glow-up with advanced features like AI Call Intelligence and AI Email Generator. The vision is to take away the mundane part of the job with AI and automation. RevOps professionals can leverage these features to put more effort into areas where human interaction is necessary.\\nThe Call Intelligence feature transcribes and analyzes hours of calls, turning them into reports with actionable insights. The AI report can pick up on customer pain points and buying signals. It scores both the agent and the customer on several metrics and provides suggestions for improvement. The user can analyze a single or a hundred calls using this feature. Corefactors has automated call analysis and made it 120 times faster - it took 6 minutes to process 235 calls, which earlier took 12.06 man-hours.\\nThe AI email generator is different from other generative AI tools in the market. It saves time on writing prompts as the platform automatically collects lead information and uses it to write contextualized and personalized emails.\\nCorefactors banks its product placement on the rising industry shift from SalesOps to RevOps. SalesOps considers the sales team to be the sole contributor to business revenue. It focuses on optimizing sales processes and managing resources for revenue growth. This strategy is effective, but it operates in silos and limits the collaboration of the sales team with the other teams. Limited collaboration leaves gaps for revenue opportunities to slip through. RevOps gives equal importance to all revenue-generating teams and provides them with tools for better alignment and synergy.\\nThe marketing team generates leads from campaigns, the sales team tries to close deals with these leads, the support team handles customer issues after the sale, and the success team is focused on nurturing customer loyalty. Without RevOps, these teams are all using separate and disparate platforms. It becomes difficult to track what's happening with each deal, identify the sales-ready leads, and provide excellent support and after-sales care.\\nWith taglines like 'Your Revenue Multiplier' and 'Think RevOps. Think Corefactors,' Corefactors is directly launching itself into the RevOps space. Founder Sharmila Sundaram mentions what users can expect from the company following the rebranding. She says, 'Businesses can expect zero revenue leakage, efficient and streamlined workflows, visibility across teams for better collaboration, optimization of processes and resources, predictable and data-driven decisions, and scalable growth with automation and integration.'\", 'rights': None, 'rank': 1286, 'topic': 'business', 'country': 'IN', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'Business Standard', 'media': 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-12/16/full/1734340397-1764.jpg', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': None, '_score': 1.9690475, '_id': 'c0a8d12462b32b0c7ee83d29eb1399c9'}], 'user_input': {'q': '*', 'search_in': ['title_summary_en'], 'lang': ['en'], 'not_lang': None, 'countries': ['IN'], 'not_countries': None, 'from': '2024-12-16 13:03:19', 'to': '2024-12-17 13:03:19', 'ranked_only': 'True', 'from_rank': None, 'to_rank': None, 'is_opinion': None, 'is_republisher': None, 'sort_by': 'relevancy', 'page': 1, 'size': 50, 'sources': None, 'not_sources': [], 'topic': 'business', 'published_date_precision': None}}\n"
